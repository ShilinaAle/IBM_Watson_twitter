Funny you should ask. I am with him right now in a crowded London bar. But we are also in 2015. f you need a really good, cathartic weep about something beautiful, I recommend this thread. Pearl, you are Thank you! When my first book became a bestseller, an acquaintance said to me: I have often thought I should write a kids book, and when I saw you gone to number one I thought, 'well, I really should, because if *she* can do it, *anyone* can.' My kids are getting so bored of me saying, this is not normal. Clearly a keeper Thank you! I have finished a thing, which is always a good feeling. I’ve lost count. How’s everyone doing today? Stunning! I've always loved that cover because it's so odd. Why the rat head? Why the giant rat in the headscarf? I never met the illustrator, so I still do not know. Yes, but at my office. I love seeing the different editions. I have never done it before, but it is been very satisfying. Rearranging books is a very soothing lockdown activity To the people asking: yes, of course I've got Harry Potter books! These aren't my only bookshelves, they're simply the ones I decided to arrange by colour during tea breaks. I’m drinking Yorkshire tea right now. Happy #NationalTeaDay, everyone. Science is the father of knowledge, but opinion breeds ignorance -- Hippocrates Had the most elaborate nightmare of my life last night: a hammer-wielding serial killer, a female scientist working on a Coronavirus vaccine & many sub-plots, one involving rescuing an ape from a window ledge. In a break between gruesome killings, I took EmmaWatson out to lunch. I LOVE that drawing that you did. Nope. I don't mind a rough edge, whereas I mistrust smoothness. Because I know another amazing person who was born on 4th October and I used that person’s birthday My God, they’re everywhere. YES, EXACTLY. Four is a bad number. Hence, ‘Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive...’ Trying not to be judgmental here, but people like you should definitely be on some kind of watchlist. I never met Lyra face-to-face, but we used to chat a lot by DM, mostly abt politics and writing. I'll never forget the ice cold shock of thinking I'd heard her name on the news and dashing to turn up the volume, telling myself 'it can't be her', even though I knew it must be. 1/2 She was such a talent and so deeply loved, as was proven by the outpouring after her death. I'm thinking of her partner, her family and friends right now and sending love. Anniversaries of loss are always hard, but I think the 1st is the worst. 2/2 I've always found even numbers smug and odd numbers quirky but loveable. Begone, heathen. Well, those people are wrong, because odd numbers are very definitely female. You’ll be saying Saturday isn’t silver next. arma rides stolen hospital bikes. One winter I caught drowning off my neighbour and then, would you believe it, I caught a car crash going round at my office. These are incredible! Choosing which idea to write is like picking a lodger, so make sure you like it enough to forgive it all the trouble it's going to put you through. Of the Potters, Prisoner of Azkaban. I was in a more financially secure place, Pottermania wasn't yet overwhelming and my daughter had started school. For the first time, I had hours a day to write and that book just wrote itself. I have ideas. Yes, definitely. Character is plot! I need to thoroughly understand why the crime was committed, and by whom, before I start plotting clues and red herrings. I still love writing by hand, so a combination. I tend to do a lot of planning by hand. Seeing my books in this condition is the highest possible compliment, so thank *you*, emiika t's hard to communicate the relationship you have with your books post-publication, once they become everybody's. There are invisible stories interwoven with the printed ones that nobody else can see. It took me years to realise where a certain idea in Potter had come from because it had taken such a circuitous, personal journey up from my subconscious. This is the strange underbelly of published work, which only the writer knows. Phoenix is very much that kind of book, so there's something reassuring about it being loved, nonetheless. And you're every bit as heroic. I hope you and all your colleagues stay safe, David Coronavirus: Harry Potter buses used as free NHS transport The devil loves tomatoes. Never mind how I know that, I just do. Flowers and jewellery are lovely, but marry the man who reassures you in a calm, compassionate voice that you're not a useless lump of meaningless flesh just because you can't make your fucking printer work. COVID19 poses a grave risk to millions of children confined in orphanages and poverty drives family separation.  Help Lumos protect children and strengthen families around the world Slytherin never looked so good. I truly appreciate her enthusiasm for my work, but your average reader doesn’t whine and scratch my leg until permitted to sit on my lap while I type. It’s brilliant, but at the same time disquieting, like an airborne jellyfish. I love this! “Everybody thinks they have good taste and a sense of humor but they couldn't possibly all have good taste.” With my favourite fantastic beast, two summers ago. It's extremely difficult to create a beast more fantastic than nature's already made. 'Look how far that little candle sends its light! That’s the way a good deed shines in a naughty world.' I identify wholeheartedly with the dog in this video and while, yes, I suppose the cat wins in a technical sense, I personally would have deducted points for its air of insufferable smugness."

Who would say such a thing? I said that the Do Nothing Democrats, together with their Mainstream Media partners, are the Hoax. They have been called out & embarrassed on this, even admitting they were wrong, but continue to spread the lie! Remember, the Cure can’t be worse than the problem itself. Be careful, be safe, use common sense! What is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions, & then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately. They get record ratings, & the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time & effort! Was just informed that the Fake News from the Thursday White House Press Conference had me speaking & asking questions of Dr. Deborah Birx. Wrong, I was speaking to our Laboratory expert, not Deborah, about sunlight etc. & the CoronaVirus. The Lamestream Media is corrupt & sick! If the Wall Street Journal “Editorial” writers had called, as they should have, they would have easily found that I was “NOT happy with the Georgia Governor on Tuesday night.” You said the opposite, and got it wrong as you often do! The Do Nothing Democrats are spending much of their money on Fake Ads. I never said that the CoronaVirus is a “Hoax”, I said that the Democrats, and the way they lied about it, are a Hoax. Also, it did start with “one person from China”, and then grew, & will be a “Miracle” end! We have now Tested more than 5 Million People. That is more than any other country in the World, and even more than  all major countries combined! It is a wonderful feeling to know that our States are loaded up with Ventilators, many brand new and high quality just off of our production lines, and that we are now in a position to help other countries that so desperately need them. Every person needing a Ventilator got one! Just spoke to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali of Ethiopia. His Country needs Ventilators, and the U.S. is in good position to help him. We will! Many testing sites are, and have been, open & available. Just passed 5 Million Tests, far more than any other country in the world. In fact, more than all other major countries combined! Don’t believe the Fake News! Thank you to the people of Colorado for the warm and gracious notes and letters sent to me for all of the Ventilators we got for you. It was my great honor! Thank you to William Perry Pendley of the Bureau of Land Management. Great job on TuckerCarlson describing some of the most beautiful land in the world! I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 5:30 P.M. Thank you! I will never let our Post Office fail. It has been mismanaged for years, especially since the advent of the internet and modern-day technology. The people that work there are great, and we’re going to keep them happy, healthy, and well! Great conversation with President Lenin Moreno of the Republic of Ecuador. We will be sending them desperately needed Ventilators, of which we have recently manufactured many, and helping them in other ways. They are fighting hard against CoronaVirus! Getting VERY good reviews of the job the Federal Government is doing on CoronaVirus. Ventilators, building hospitals, beds and yes, Testing, have been handled incredibly well. Testing is getting exponentially better every day. Love seeing our Country safely opening up! Just spoke to President Juan Orlando Hernandez of the Republic of Honduras. We work closely together on the Southern Border. Will be helping him with his request for Ventilators and Testing. Great News! Randall Stephenson, the CEO of heavily indebted AT&T, which owns and presides over Fake News CNN, is leaving, or was forced out. Anyone who lets a garbage “network” do and say the things that CNN does, should leave ASAP. Hopefully replacement will be much better! I (or VP) never gave Governor Brian Kemp an OK on those few businesses outside of the Guidelines. FAKE NEWS! Spas, beauty salons, tattoo parlors, & barber shops should take a little slower path, but I told the Governor to do what is right for the great people of Georgia (& USA)! Just spoke to President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador. Will be helping them with Ventilators, which are desperately needed. They have worked well with us on immigration at the Southern Border! Just spoke to my friend, President Joko Widodo of the Republic of Indonesia. Asking for Ventilators, which we will provide. Great cooperation between us! Our Country wants to move safely forward. There is a tremendous pent up demand. We will open big! The Fake and totally corrupt News is after her as a means of getting to me. She’s smart and strong, knows the truth. Already a heroine to many! Getting VERY good reviews of the job the Federal Government is doing on CoronaVirus. Ventilators, building hospitals, beds and yes, Testing, have been handled incredibly well. Testing is getting exponentially better every day. Love seeing our Country safely opening up! Disgraceful. Should join the Republican Party! Governor JimJusticeWV is a tremendous fighter for the incredible people of West Virginia. Big Jim is strong on Life, the Second Amendment, and Building the Wall! With Governors like Jim, America will recover and get back to business. Jim has my Complete and Total Endorsement! Congressman Bill Posey is a tremendous fighter for the Great State of Florida. He is a big supporter of our #MAGA Agenda – Strong on Crime, the Second Amendment, and Loves our Veterans and Law Enforcement. Bill has my Complete and Total Endorsement! Congressman MikeTurnerOH is a strong supporter and fighter for the People of Ohio! He will help us #MAGA!

My performance at #SuperSaturdayNight is a week away Микрофон watch live on can y’all stop Thank you Oprah for caring, and for helping bring light to the mental health crisis happening around the world. Excited to see u monsters I am so snatched I don’t know what to do Inspired by when I worked as a burlesque dancer as I was working to become a star, these shades remind me of my times on the lower east side in New York and the identity I created for myself then. I assume many would expect my first palette to be full of crazy colors, but the truth is when I was first discovering my identity, self-love, and compassion, I used colors that would contour, shape, and amplify my look in a way that made me feel beautiful. That made me feel famous from the inside out, even when no one knew who I was. Step into our glam room, and enjoy the FAME.

For the millions of women and children around the world sheltering with their abuser, home can be dangerous. with $500,000 specifically designated towards our Together For Her campaign, supporting women against domestic violence through the provision of funds and resources to trusted domestic violence shelters around the world. Our rallying cry is this: Please join us in showing women experiencing domestic violence that they are not alone – we are behind them, with them, for them If anyone is looking for a weekend watch (at least I think it’s the weekend?), Eliza Hittman’s extraordinary film #NeverRarelySometimesAlways is now avail on demand.

Leo sends his love This is a terrifying time & I know a lot of us are looking for tangible ways to help stop the spread of #coronavirus. My friend at Cedars Sinai told me that they are in dire need of N95 masks for their staff. If anyone has N95 masks to spare, please email Healthcare staff are putting their lives on the line everyday during this pandemic. Please spread the word so we can ensure these hospital workers stay healthy and can continue to help those affected by #COVID19.

Tonight, catch my dear friend #WhatsEatingAmerica explores social & political issues around the US––all thru the lens of food (my kinda show!) Can’t wait to hear what you all think. Don't miss it! Puppy update - things are warming up here Absolutely blown away by this guy’s work last night at the LA Art Show. If you have a chance to check it out in person this weekend, I 100% recommend it. His sculptures are just unreal to witness in person. Kazu, your talent is unbelievable and I’m so lucky to call you a friend! Clothes have always been apart of my storytelling. Last night at the CostumeAwards, I got to celebrate the people that help bring those stories to life thru clothes. Thank u for the Spotlight Award, & thank u to all the amazing costume designers for helping me do what I love Excuse me while I fangirl but this one’s performance in PARASITE is truly unreal. Congrats on the well-deserved SAG win!!!  Such an amazing night - thanks for having me #SAGAwards! And yes, getting that bracelet out of my hair was a disaster. Incredibly humbled that #BombshellMovie is receiving the Stanley Kramer Award from the producersguild tonight. Thank you for this amazing honor for a film that means so much to me If you’ve ever wondered what it’s like to burst into tears on national television from laughing so hard, watch jimmykimmellive tonight to see me live that nightmare for you Holy shit. I am floored. Thank you Making BOMBSHELL is one of the great highlights of my career.  Thank you to my fellow producers, our incredible director Jay Roach and our brilliant screenwriter Charles Randolph, and a multi-talented group of actors and artists who gave 100% of themselves in making this film. It’s gonna be a great day. Quick update on the Theron canine clan Голова собакиСобака Tell me some important advice you’ve received that helps you get through the work day - I need some inspo! Such sad news to wake up to this morning. One of my first jobs ever in Hollywood was with Danny Aiello and he was everything you could’ve imagined - funny, gracious, kind, and a true legend of his craft. You will be missed, my friend Whoops. Got a bit too excited about the #SAGAwards nomination for our #BombshellMovie cast...CONGRATS ALL YOU BEAUTIFUL HUMANS!!! So grateful to have gone on this journey with you all As a producer on #BombshellMovie,  I feel extra grateful about my and Margot’s nominations today. We fought to get this movie made because we thought now more than ever this was an important story to tell. Thank you so much to the HFPA In 2 weeks you’ll get to see the full thing, but for now I’m excited to share an exclusive clip 12 years ago, I founded CTAOP to invest in African youth and help them keep themselves safe from HIV/AIDS. Today, on #WorldAIDSDay, the fight is still as strong as ever and we must not turn our backs on the 38 million people who are living with the virus. This year’s UNAIDS theme for #WorldAIDSDay is “Communities Make the Difference”, which goes to the heart of our mission and is something I strongly believe in. I’ve seen firsthand the power that communities have to elicit change and it never ceases to amaze me how much can get done when we share a common goal and act on it. The only way to eradicate this disease is by coming together and investing in those communities that need our support now more than ever. Stand with me on International Day to End Violence against Women. Let’s stop using language that blames victims, objectifies women and normalizes sexual harassment. There is no excuse for rape. I’ve gotten to see BoyzIIMen live twice in one year and honestly can say it’s a highlight of my life. SO much fun tonight at our CTAOP event. Thx to these incredible dudes for ending the night in the best way and to everyone who came out to support the youth of South Africa Clearly I’m very stoked that Kate McKinnon presented me with my glamourmag #GlamourWOTY award tonight. And just wait till you see this woman in bombshellmovie. She will blow your mind. You’re a real one, Kate"
